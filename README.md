	Hello!
	My name is Jakub Cisowski, and this is one of my first projects.
	The project concept is to build page as similar as possible to Google.com homepage.

	Skills that helped me complete this project:
		 - managing positioning of elements by basic understanding of 'border-box' box model, position and display properties
		 - basic understanding of Web Developer Tools
		 - getting a bit of help from Google and Gitter
		 - the Odin Project itself! I might never have got that job done but for this course.
